üé¨ Cinema Booking System ‚Äì C++ Project Description
Project Title: Cinema Booking System
Language Used: C++
Project Type: Console-based
Course: Programming Fundamentals (PF)

üìå Project Overview:
The Cinema Booking System is a C++ console application designed to simulate a real-world movie ticket booking system. It allows users to view available movies, check showtimes, book tickets, and manage seat availability. The system uses basic object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts like classes, objects, functions, arrays, and file handling to store and retrieve booking data.

üí° Features:
Display list of available movies with show timings

Seat layout display (e.g., available/booked)

Ticket booking by choosing movie, showtime, and seat number

Ticket cancellation option

Admin login for adding new movies and schedules (optional)

User-friendly console menu system

Simple file handling to save bookings (optional for advanced version)

üõ†Ô∏è Core Concepts Used:
C++ Classes & Objects

Functions and Modular Code

Conditional Statements & Loops

Arrays (or 2D Arrays for seats)

File Handling (optional: for storing bookings/movies)

Switch Case & Menus
